I shared my passion for trees and earth with my best friends before school - my mother and grandfather. As the youngest of four children in the family, I was greatly loved and I loved greatly, testing my loving sister's patience over the years.",
      "EDUCATION_TITLE": "My Educational Journey",
      "EDUCATION_P1": "My university student sister registered me for primary school, and my university student brother registered me for preparatory school. As the capable child my dear father described, I managed all my subsequent registrations myself. I met many of my friends, who are the greatest values my educational life gave me, at Rize Anatolian High School. Again, I loved greatly and was greatly loved.",
      "EDUCATION_P2": "In 2007, I graduated from <strong>Istanbul Faculty of Medicine</strong>, created by senior professors who said 'If you don't have an idea about the diagnosis until the patient enters the room and sits down, quit this job.'",
      "FAMILY_TITLE": "Family",
      "FAMILY_P1": "I worked in the pharmaceutical industry for a while. During this time, I had already fallen in love, following our family tradition that has continued for generations. Despite my feminist grandmother's attempts to instill anti-marriage sentiments throughout my childhood, in 2008 I married my beloved Mahir, whom I had known since I was twelve.",
      "PEDIATRICS_TITLE": "My Pediatric Adventure",
      "PEDIATRICS_P1": "With a foundation far from all professional reasoning, I started my Pediatric residency at <strong>Marmara University</strong> in 2011, simply because I love children very much. In this institution, where patients are seen in the number/variety of a Training Research Hospital with a university approach, I got very tired and learned a lot.",
      "PEDIATRICS_P2": "After completing my residency, I returned to Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital, which I had left due to a brief mandatory service adventure, and began working as a pediatrician. During the 11 years I worked in the emergency room, pediatric outpatient clinics, and all services, I experienced great professional satisfaction with so many cases and challenges that could not be found anywhere else.",
      "WELLCHILD_TITLE": "Well-Child Medicine",
      "WELLCHILD_P1": "Until then, as a physician with extensive practice with sick children, the fact that my daughter would be born in 2014 pushed me with great curiosity toward 'Well-Child Medicine.' With the intention of academically strengthening my insatiable field readings, I started the <strong>Social Pediatrics Doctoral Program</strong> at Marmara University in 2019. I passed my doctoral qualification in 2021 and continue my academic life with my thesis process. In 2023, I graduated from Istanbul University's <strong>Child Development</strong> undergraduate program.",
      "NEWBEGINNING_TITLE": "New Beginning",
      "NEWBEGINNING_P1": "As an admired professor said, I left my work-school Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital in July 2022, having had the opportunity to confirm the experience that 'To be a good doctor, enough patients and the right books are sufficient.'",
      "NEWBEGINNING_P2": "It was time to practice evidence-based pediatric medicine in the light of scientific data with the means, time, and proximity.",
      "NEWBEGINNING_P3": "I am starting a new journey with the support of my spouse, daughter, mother, extended family, and friends whom I can never get enough of. From now on, I will welcome my children in my own clinic and enjoy them surprising me every day despite all my years of experience with children."
