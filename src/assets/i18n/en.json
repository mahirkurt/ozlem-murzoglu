As the youngest of four children, I was deeply loved and I loved deeply, testing my dear sister's patience for years.",
      "EDUCATION_JOURNEY": "My Educational Journey",
      "EDUCATION_TEXT": "My university student sister enrolled me in primary school, while my university student brother enrolled me in prep school. As the capable child my dear father described, I managed all my subsequent enrollments myself. I met many of my lifelong friends at Rize Anatolian High School, the greatest value my education gave me. Again, I loved deeply and was deeply loved.",
      "EDUCATION_TEXT2": "In 2007, I graduated from <strong>Istanbul Medical Faculty</strong>, created by my distinguished professors who said 'If you don't have an idea about the diagnosis by the time the patient enters the room and sits down, quit this job.'",

      "PEDIATRICS_JOURNEY": "My Pediatrics Journey",
      "PEDIATRICS_TEXT": "Far from all professional reasoning, simply because I love children very much, I started my Pediatrics specialization at <strong>Marmara University</strong> in 2011. In this institution where patients were treated in the number/variety of a Training and Research Hospital with a university approach, I got very tired and learned a lot.",
      "PEDIATRICS_TEXT2": "After completing my specialization, I returned to Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital, which I had left due to a brief mandatory service adventure, and started working as a pediatrician. During the total of 11 years I worked in the emergency room, children's clinics, and all wards, I experienced great professional satisfaction with more cases and challenges than could be found anywhere else.",

      "HEALTHY_CHILD_TEXT": "As a physician with extensive practice with sick children until then, the upcoming birth of my daughter in 2014 pushed me with great curiosity into 'Healthy Child Medicine'. To academically strengthen my insatiable field readings, I started the Social Pediatrics Doctoral Program at Marmara University in 2019. I passed my doctoral qualification in 2021 and continue my academic life with my thesis process. In 2023, I graduated from Istanbul University's Child Development undergraduate program.",

        "content": "<h2>HPV Vaccine</h2><p><strong>Why Get Vaccinated?</strong></p><p><strong>HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine</strong> can prevent infection with some types of human papillomavirus.</p><p>HPV infections can cause certain types of cancers including:</p><ul><li>Cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers in women</li><li>Penile cancer in men</li><li>Anal cancer in men and women</li><li>Cancers of the tonsils, base of tongue, and back of throat (oropharyngeal cancer) in men and women</li></ul><p>HPV infections can also cause anogenital warts.</p><p>HPV vaccine can prevent over 90% of cancers caused by HPV.</p><p>HPV is spread through intimate skin-to-skin contact or sexual activity. HPV infections are so common that nearly all people get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives.</p><p>Most HPV infections go away by themselves within 2 years. But sometimes HPV infections last longer and can cause cancers later in life.</p><h2>HPV Vaccines</h2><p>HPV vaccine is routinely recommended for adolescents at 11 or 12 years of age to ensure they are protected before they are exposed to the virus. HPV vaccine may be given beginning at age 9 years, and is recommended for everyone through 26 years of age.</p><p>HPV vaccine may be given to adults 27 through 45 years of age, based on discussion between the patient and healthcare provider.</p><p>Most children who get the first dose before 15 years of age need 2 doses of HPV vaccine. People who get the first dose at 15 years of age or older, and younger people with certain immunocompromising conditions need 3 doses. Your healthcare provider can give you more information.</p><p>HPV vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.</p><h2>Talk with Your Healthcare Provider</h2><p>Tell your vaccine provider if the person getting the vaccine:</p><ul><li>Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of HPV vaccine, or has any severe, life-threatening allergies</li><li>Is pregnant. HPV vaccine is not recommended until after pregnancy</li></ul><p>In some cases, your healthcare provider may decide to postpone HPV vaccination to a future visit.</p><p>People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting HPV vaccine.</p><p>Your healthcare provider can give you more information.</p><h2>Risks of a Vaccine Reaction</h2><ul><li>Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site can happen after HPV vaccination.</li><li>Fever or headache can happen after HPV vaccination.</li></ul><p>People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.</p><p>As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.</p><h2>What If There Is a Serious Problem?</h2><p>An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 911 and get the person to the nearest hospital.</p><p>For other signs that concern you, call your healthcare provider.</p><h2>More Information</h2><p>Some resources where you can find more detailed information about vaccines:</p><ul><li>Turkish Ministry of Health Vaccine Portal: <a href='https://asi.saglik.gov.tr/'>https://asi.saglik.gov.tr/</a></li><li>World Health Organization Vaccines Page: <a href='https://www.who.int/health-topics/vaccines-and-immunization'>https://www.who.int/health-topics/vaccines-and-immunization</a></li><li>US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Vaccines Page: <a href='https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines'>https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines</a></li><li>US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vaccines Page: <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html'>https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html</a></li></ul><p><em>Vaccine Information Statement ● HPV (8/6/21) ● English Translation ● www.immunize.org/vis<br/>Distributed by the Immunization Action Coalition</em></p>"

HPV infections are so common that nearly all people get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives.</p><p>Most HPV infections go away by themselves within 2 years. But sometimes HPV infections last longer and can cause cancers later in life.</p><h2>HPV Vaccines</h2><p>HPV vaccine is routinely recommended for adolescents at 11 or 12 years of age to ensure they are protected before they are exposed to the virus. HPV vaccine may be given beginning at age 9 years, and is recommended for everyone through 26 years of age.</p><p>HPV vaccine may be given to adults 27 through 45 years of age, based on discussion between the patient and healthcare provider.</p><p>Most children who get the first dose before 15 years of age need 2 doses of HPV vaccine. People who get the first dose at 15 years of age or older, and younger people with certain immunocompromising conditions need 3 doses. Your healthcare provider can give you more information.</p><p>HPV vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.</p><h2>Talk with Your Healthcare Provider</h2><p>Tell your vaccine provider if the person getting the vaccine:</p><ul><li>Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of HPV vaccine, or has any severe, life-threatening allergies</li><li>Is pregnant. HPV vaccine is not recommended until after pregnancy</li></ul><p>In some cases, your healthcare provider may decide to postpone HPV vaccination to a future visit.</p><p>People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting HPV vaccine.</p><p>Your healthcare provider can give you more information.</p><h2>Risks of a Vaccine Reaction</h2><ul><li>Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site can happen after HPV vaccination.</li><li>Fever or headache can happen after HPV vaccination.</li></ul><p>People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.</p><p>As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.</p><p>What If There Is a Serious Problem?</p><p>An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 911 and get the person to the nearest hospital.</p><p>For other signs that concern you, call your healthcare provider.</p>"
