# i18n Enforcement Rules

## 1. Zero Tolerance for Hardcoded Text
You are strictly FORBIDDEN from adding hardcoded text strings to any HTML template or TypeScript component file.
-   **Exception**: Logging statements (console.log), internal IDs, or non-user-facing strings.
-   **Enforcement**: Every time you write code that includes user-visible text, you **MUST** immediately pause and run the i18n workflow.

## 2. Mandatory Workflow Execution
Whenever you modify UI text, you **MUST** follow the steps defined in:
"D:\Repositories\ozlem-murzoglu\.agent\workflows\i18n-flow.md"

1.  **Check**: Does a key already exist in src/assets/i18n/tr.json?
2.  **Extract**: If not, add it to tr.json using the PAGE.SECTION.KEY naming convention.
3.  **Implement**: Use the {{ 'KEY' | translate }} pipe or translate.get('KEY') service.

## 3. Review Protocol
Before submitting ANY task that involves UI changes, you must:
1.  Read tr.json.
2.  Verify that your new keys are present and correctly formatted (valid JSON).
3.  Verify that your HTML uses the correct keys.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Failure to follow this rule will result in broken translations and inconsistencies. **Always** check tr.json.
